# Identity-Document-Verification-Using-Blockchain


## The problem it solves
The decentralized blockchain-based identity/document verification DApp solves the problem of trust in identity and document verification. In today's world, we often have to rely on third-party verification services to verify identities and documents. However, these services are often centralized and can be prone to errors, fraud, and hacking.

With our DApp, individuals can take control of their own identity and data, providing a trustless and transparent way to verify identities and documents. The use of blockchain technology ensures that sensitive information is securely stored and can be verified by anyone, anywhere in the world. The added layer of facial recognition and face matching also enhances security, making it more difficult for fraudulent activity to occur.

By providing a decentralized solution for identity and document verification, our DApp empowers individuals and businesses to take control of their own verification needs, without the need for costly and centralized third-party services. This provides a more secure and efficient way to verify identities and documents, promoting trust and transparency in a variety of industries, including finance, healthcare, real estate, and more.
